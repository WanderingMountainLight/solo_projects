# Calculator Rebuild

A command-line calculator built from scratch using a flowchart-first approach.

## Features
- Input validation with try/except error handling
- While loops for user input validation
- Divide-by-zero protection
- Clean code (10/10 pylint score)

## Context
After completing Launch School's calculator walkthrough, I rebuilt this independently using only a flowchart to test my ability to translate logic into code without following step-by-step instructions.
