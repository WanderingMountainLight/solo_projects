# Solo Loan Calculator

## Project Description
A loan payment calculator that computes monthly payments based on principle, APR, and loan term. This is a solo rebuild of the Launch School PY101 mortgage calculator project to test mastery of core Python concepts without referencing previous code.

## Learning Goals
- Build a complete program from scratch using only flowchart reference
- Implement robust input validation and error handling
- Practice incremental development with git feature branches
- Handle edge cases (0% APR, invalid input)
- Stretch: Generate amortization schedules

## Features

### Phase 1: Core Calculator (Happy Path)
- [ ] Accept principle amount
- [ ] Accept interest rate (APR)
- [ ] Accept loan term
- [ ] Calculate monthly payment
- [ ] Display loan summary

### Phase 2: Input Handling
- [ ] Accept months or years for loan term
- [ ] Clean user input (commas, $, %)

### Phase 3: Validation
- [ ] Validate numeric input
- [ ] Handle 0% APR special case
- [ ] Reject invalid/negative values
- [ ] Loop on invalid input

### Phase 4: User Experience
- [ ] Calculator loop (multiple calculations)
- [ ] Format currency output
- [ ] Clear screen between calculations

### Phase 5: Stretch Goal
- [ ] Generate amortization schedule

## Timeline
- Start Date: Nov 19, 2025
- Target Completion (Phases 1-4): November 20, 2025
- Stretch Goal (Phase 5): After core complete
- Estimated effort: 7-8 hours (full rebuild from scratch)
